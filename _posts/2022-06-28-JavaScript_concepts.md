The code written with arrow functions looks compact. Functions are easier to write and read. One of the reasons is an implicit return by simply omitting the curly braces.
Arrow syntax doesn’t contain its context and automatically bind this to the surrounding code’s context

If you work with global scope and Object.prototype properties use function.
If you work with object constructors use class.
If you face any other situation use arrow function.
