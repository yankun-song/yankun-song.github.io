- [Don't Get Down-Leveled or How to Tell a Good Story (From a Principal at Amazon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU6BVxtGd5g)

  You have to do well in both technical and behavioral parts. A downlevel can happen if you fall into the light green part.

  The `STAR` strategy is not a good choice for you to describe a character, although it's good for describing what happened.

  The [`Man in the hole`](https://pipdecks.com/pages/man-in-a-hole) is a better tactic.

  In addition, we need to find the requirements from job description and expections of the company, and then anchor these to your stories.

  Summary:

  - Levels are relative. Get some information from glassdoor and FYI.
  - Poor Behavioral responses lead to down-leveling. If you didn't do well in the technical part, they wouldn't give you an offer at all.
  - Use U-story shape
  - Imperfect but positive success
  - Use STAR to check
  - Don't lie
