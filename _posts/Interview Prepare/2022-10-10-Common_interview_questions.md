## 自我介绍

After graduation from college, I was a materials science researcher. My research focus was mechanical properties simulation, and I published 1 paper and 2 patents.

During my study at Columbia University for my master's degree, I was fascinated by the power of python. After learning some data science stuff, I decided to devote myself to software development.

Most recently, I was working as a fullstack engineer and our team was working on an open source product called Contractual. I was mainly responsible for the backend development, like designing REST APIs, designing databases and writing unit tests.

Last year, I was a frontend developer intern at Boston Software Group. My main duty was to build a website with React. So I'm familiar with the frontend tech stack, like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In my work, I have integrated CI/CD pipeline for reduced risk and a smoother path to producation.

Recently, I'm getting more experience on AWS, and I'm a AWS certified Cloud Practitioner.

In my free time, besides taking care of my cat and turtles, I'm running a close-knit coding community. We do some data structure and algo challenges and pair programming every weekend.

To conclude, I believe my skill set, espeically my xxx and xxx knowledge will help me to be a good fit for this position.
